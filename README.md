# Repo-Example

How to write a good Github Repo? 

### gitignore

gitignore - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore

### .travis.yml

As a continuous integration platform, Travis CI supports your development process by automatically building and testing code changes, providing immediate feedback on the success of the change. Travis CI can also automate other parts of your development process by managing deployments and notifications.Continuous Integration is the practice of merging in small code changes frequently - rather than merging in a large change at the end of a development cycle. The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smaller increments.

### MIT license

The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the late 1980s. As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, high license compatibility.

### requirements.txt

This is where a requirements.txt file comes into play. As long as the developers of this app provide a file listing the necessary packages, we can simply $ pip install -r requirements.txt and voila! All of the program’s “dependencies” will be downloaded, installed, and ready to go in one fell swoop.

### CONTRIBUTING.md

A CONTRIBUTING.md file, in your open source repository or site, provides potential project contributors with a short guide to how they can help with your project or study group.

### CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

A code of conduct defines standards for how to engage in a community. It signals an inclusive environment that respects all contributions.
